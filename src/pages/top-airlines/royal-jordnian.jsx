                        On December 15, 1963, RJ (Royal Jordanian) was established as the national airline of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. It is headquartered in Amman, Jordan (A country in West Asia). The airline commenced operations on December 15, 1963, following a royal order issued by the late King Hussein. Aalya was named after Princess Alia bint Al Hussein of Jordan (born February 13, 1956), King Hussein's eldest child. Alia (the Royal Jordanian Airline) began operations in Amman with two aircraft Handley Page Dart Heralds and a Douglas DC-7, reaching Kuwait City, Beirut, and Cairo. In 1964, another DC-7 was put in place, and service to Jeddah began. Alia commenced service to Rome, its first European destination, in 1965.
