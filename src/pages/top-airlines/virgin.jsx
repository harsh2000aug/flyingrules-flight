                        Virgin Atlantic launched its first scheduled service between Gatwick and Newark on June 22, 1984, making use of a leased Boeing 747-200 (registration G-VIRG), dubbed Maiden Voyager, previously operated by Aerolneas Argentinas. Its activities were reinforced from the start by exploiting existing Virgin Group resources, including tickets sold via Virgin Megastores record stores. Virgin Atlantic's fleet has been entirely made up of widebody aircraft from Airbus and Boeing.
