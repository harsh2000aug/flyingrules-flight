          <p>
            Clive Beddoe, David Neeleman, Mark Hill, Tim Morgan, and Donald Bell formed Westjet on June 27, 1994. The airline's early routes were located in Western Canada, which provided the airline its name. The first-ever WestJet flight, a Boeing 737-200, took off on February 29, 1996. With a fleet of three used Boeing 737-200 airplanes and 225 employees, the airline initially served Calgary, Vancouver, Edmonton, Kelowna, and Winnipeg. By the end of the year, the corporation had expanded its network to include Regina, Saskatoon, and Victoria.
