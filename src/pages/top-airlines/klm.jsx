                        KLM The national airline of the Netherlands is Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij N.V., also known as Royal Dutch Airlines. KLM's corporate offices are in Amstelveen, while the nearby Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam serves as its main hub. It belongs to the SkyTeam airline alliance and is a part of the Air France-KLM corporation. As of 2021, KLM is the longest-continuously running airline in the world, with 35,488 people and a fleet of 110 aircraft. KLM provides regular passenger and cargo flights to 145 destinations. The history of KLM starts from the ELTA aviation display in Amsterdam, which was sponsored in 1919 by a young pilot lieutenant by the name of Albert Plesman. Over 500,000 people attended the expo, and once it concluded, numerous Dutch business interests planned to launch a Dutch airline, with Plesman selected to lead it. The KNLM had not yet been established when Queen Wilhelmina bestowed its "Royal" ("Koninklijke") predicate on it in September 1919. Eight Dutch businessmen, notably Frits Fentener van Vlissingen, established KLM on October 7, 1919, making it one of the earliest commercial aviation firms. Plesman was appointed as its first director and administrator. KLM and KLM Cityhopper are the two main airlines that make up the KLM Group, together carrying 34.1 million fliers and 621,000 tonnes of cargo. KLM provides direct connections to important economic hubs across the globe with a large network of 92 European cities and 70 intercontinental destinations.
