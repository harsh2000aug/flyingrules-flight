            On March 9, 1967, Herb Kelleher and Rollin King established the Air Southwest Co. When it began operating as an intrastate airline, exclusively within the state of Texas, first connecting Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio, it changed its name to Southwest Airlines Co. in 1971. In 1979, it launched regional interstate service, and during the next decades, it expanded countrywide. In addition to 42 states, Southwest currently offers airport service to a number of places in Central America.

          <p>
            Southwest employs a rolling hub and point-to-point network in contrast to other US airlines, and it provides free checked baggage. There are solely Boeing 737s in its fleet. The airline conducts over 4,000 departures per day and employs close to 66,100 workers during peak travel periods.

            Southwest Airlines has only ever flown Boeing 737 aircraft throughout its existence, with the exception of the years 1979 to 1980 and 1983 to 1985, when it leased and flew a few Boeing 727-200 aircraft. Currently, Southwest is the biggest Boeing 737 aircraft operator in the world. Southwest's pilots and flight attendants are free to crew any aircraft in the fleet because they are all of the same basic kind.
