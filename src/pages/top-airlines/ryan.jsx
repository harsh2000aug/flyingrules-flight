            first-rate air travel services. From modest origins, they have grown
            into a leader in aviation worldwide, known for their focus on the
            needs of the client and steadfast commitment to quality. Its main
            operational bases are the Dublin and London Stansted airports, and
            its headquarters are in Swords, Dublin, Ireland. Ryanair UK, Buzz,
            Lauda Europe, and Malta Air are sibling airlines that comprise most
            of the Ryanair Holdings airline family. The largest airline in
            Ireland surpassed all other airlines in the world regarding
            scheduled foreign passengers in 2016. The airline operates more than
            500 planes. Due to the liberalization of the aviation sector in
            Europe in 1997 and the success of its low-cost business strategy, it
            has been known for its quick expansion. Over 40 countries in Europe,
            North Africa (Morocco), and the Middle East (Israel and Jordan) are

            of whom are contracted by organizations to fly aboard Ryanair

            were utilized to turn it into a pan-European carrier. Revenues grew
            from €231 million in 1998 to €1.843 billion in 2003 and €3.013
