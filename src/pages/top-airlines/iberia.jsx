                        Iberia is Spain's national airline. It was founded in 1927 and has its headquarters in Ciudad Lineal, Madrid, Spain. From its primary base, Madrid-Barajas Airport, it operates an international network of services. Iberia is part of the International Airlines Group, which also operates Iberia Regional (operated by an independent airline called Air Nostrum) and Iberia Express. Flight operations began on December 14, 1927. Within a year, the Spanish government supported the company in providing postal transportation between Barcelona and Madrid during the despotism of Miguel Primo de Rivera. Spain's aviation industries were merged and nationalized as a general-interest public utility in early 1928. British Airways and Iberia declared plans to merge in July 2008, with each airline retaining its original brand. The acquisition was approved by the European Commission and the United States Department of Transportation in July, and the two airlines began working together on transatlantic operations with American Airlines.

                        Iberia Airline Business Class is available on Spanish domestic and inter-European flights. The seats are identical to those in the economy cabin, with the middle (B and E) seats closed off. Improved ground services, including priority check-in, security, boarding, luggage handling, and lounge access, are also included with Business Class tickets. Business Plus, on the other hand, is available on long-haul flights to the Americas and South Africa. This travel class incorporates international business class amenities as well as lie-flat seating. For economy, Iberia has adopted a more American, or "a la carte" style, giving a buy-on-board service designated "Tu Men" for meals, refreshments, and beverages for domestic and European flights.
