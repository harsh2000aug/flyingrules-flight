            In total, there are six airports in London: Heathrow, Stansted,
            Luton, Gatwick, City, and Southend. Any one of London's six
            international airports ensures a first-rate travel experience.
            Passenger assistants are available at several airports to help
            travellers get around, and those who want more support can take
